# [üî• Token-Grabber](https://youtu.be/LYHPZXgqSPQ)
 Advanced grabber that grabs browser passwords, cookies, and Discord tokens with the computer information.<br>
### üêµ Features
   - [x] Protection (AntiDebug, AntiEmulation, AntiWebSniffers, AntiVM, AntiSandboxie) which is controlled through the settings file.
   - [x] Gateway support, you can create your execution with the built-in library that I made; (There is a block of code after the grabbing which you can add your things to do, I added as an example Spread which is controlled through the settings file).
   - [x] Spread to the victim's friends after grabbing. 
   - [x] Discord webhooks integration. 
   - [x] Grabs tokens from all installed clients even if the main path changed and deletes accounts duplicates.
   - [x] 18 hardcoded known tokens locations.
   - [x] Grabs PC information + token information (IP, CPU, GPU, WINKEY).
   - [x] Sends screenshot of all screens at the moment of the grabbing.
   - [x] Grabs browser cookies and passwords.
   - [x] Supports Brave, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and OperaGx. [Password & Cookies stealer]
   - [x] Self-updating, When a new account is logged or password changed will be sent again with the new information.
   - [x] Bypasses Anti-Token-Grabbers.
   - [x] Supports grabbing from Firefox-based browsers (Pale Moon, WaterFox, Firefox [I will add more in the future]) <br><br>
   - [ ]  Local cache.
   - [ ]  18 hardcoded paths üòï (Because I prefer dynamic).
   - [ ]  Works pretty slow (18 seconds on average) because it was taking lots of CPU usage, now it's pretty silent and should work at the same time for all CPUs.
 
### üì£ Some notes

 This project was created for educational purposes only, so please do not use it to harm and damage;
 This project was started because I wanted to learn about Discord's infrastructure and possible exploits, mean-while I made the base of this token-grabber (like a year ago) but, not long ago I continued this project and this is the final result, of course, I will update it and add more features in the future but mean-while remember to use your power for the good üò≤.
